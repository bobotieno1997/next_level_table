# Next level Table

In most reports, tables are often avoided due to their limited visual appeal, potential for information overload, and reduced focus on key insights.
However, there are situations where using a table becomes necessary. The challenge lies in overcoming its limitations while maintaining a clean, visually appealing design.
To achieve this, I created a next-level table, combining a minimalistic aesthetic with a focus on driving attention to the key metrics that matter most
